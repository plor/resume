My name is Jordan Walker and I am a software engineer seeking new opportunities in my career.  I previously worked with Phethala Thongsavanh at the US Geological Survey.  He recently took a position with your company and has told me that there are some chances to work on interesting projects in an emerging Agile environment.  I would like to hear more about the opportunities available, and see whether or not I would be a good fit at your company.

With over seven years of experience at a premiere science agency of the federal government, as well as several years of student employment working with weather data operations, I have found myself drawn to programming systems related to environmental data and scientific programming.  In this time I picked up a lot of the domain knowledge that makes me a more productive programmer and allows me to have more effective communication with the domain experts.  Within the same time period I have worked on adopting the Agile philosophy for programming and project planning.  This philosophy and set of methodologies in my view allows for maximal team effectiveness by encouraging a consistent output with accountability and value delivery.  I am glad I have worked at an Agile workplace and have learned what it takes to make it work.  These attributes in addition to my education and programming experience make me an exceptional candidate.

I am submitting my resume as I believe I am a good fit for this position.  I would like to ask for the pleasure of an interview to discuss the position in person, and find whether it is a good fit for all parties.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you for the opportunity.
